<!--	<img alt="Two Neuton batteries" class="floatRight" src="https://dam.generac.com/ImConvServlet/imconv/ad9451ee0eae082b561a25c022d6fca831c6fbc2/original">-->

<h2>What types of batteries do Neuton mowers use?</h2>
	<p>Neuton mowers use two types of rechargeable batteries: 24-Volt (24V) and 36-Volt (36V). The battery should not leak, regardless of the storage position. The battery is completely maintenance-free; you never need to add water. However, all rechargeable batteries eventually need replacement. With proper care, the battery should last three to five years.</p>


	<p>Before charging the battery, read all instructions and cautionary markings in your Owner's Manual and on your mower. Do not operate your mower until you have read and understand all instructions and the battery is fully charged. Read the safety considerations section of your Owner's Manual before performing any repairs or maintenance.</p>


	<h2>How should I maintain my Neuton battery for the longest life possible?
	</h2>


	<p><strong>All Neuton Batteries</strong></p>


	<p>Fully charge the battery directly after each use, even if you only use the mower for a short time. Never store the battery in a discharged or partially discharged state. Keep fully charged batteries disconnected from the charger, and keep the charger unplugged to keep it from drawing power. Try not to drain the battery completely; when you notice the battery losing power, stop and swap in a spare.</p>


	<p><strong>Please remember to remove the battery from mower and fully recharge before storing it for the winter.</strong> Store it separate from the mower in a dry environment. The battery is safe to store at temperatures of 5° F (-15° C) to 104° F (40° C). Recharge the battery every 1-2 months during the off season in temperatures between 32° F (0° C) and 104° F (+40° C).
</p>
<p><strong>36V Battery</strong></p>

<p>Before you use your mower for the first time in the spring, be sure to fully charge the battery. In general, you should charge the battery for 10-12 hours. If you have an auto-shutoff charger, it will be about 14 hours before the charger shuts off. When the battery is fully charged, unplug the charger from the battery and wall.</p>

	</p>

<p><strong>24V Battery</strong></p>
	<p>Always store your battery fully charged. In general, you should charge your 24V battery for 20-30 hours. When the battery is fully charged, unplug the charger from the battery and wall.</p>

<h2>How much run time can I expect from the battery?</h2>

<p>Under typical mowing conditions, the battery charge should last for approximately 45 to 60 minutes; this may diminish over time. The run time depends on the length, density, and dampness of the grass as well as battery charging time and mowing height. If the grass is dense or damp, the battery charge may diminish more quickly. Raising the cutting height and keeping the blade sharp can help to alleviate the load on the battery and motor.
</p>
<p>If you intend to use your mower and trimmer for longer periods, we recommend that you purchase an extra battery. That way, you can have a second fully charged battery ready so you can continue mowing.</p>
