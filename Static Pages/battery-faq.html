  <p>We offer two types of batteries: 24 volts and 36 volts. The Battery should not leak, regardless of the position in which it is stored. The Battery is completely maintenance free. You never need to add water. However, as with all rechargeable Batteries, after years of use they will eventually need replacement.</p>
  <p>With proper care, this Battery should last three (3) to five (5) years.</p>
  <p><strong>Please remember to recharge your batteries before storing them for the winter.</strong></p>
  <div class="alert alert--warning">Before charging the battery, read all instructions and cautionary markings in your Owner's Manual and on your mower. Do not operate your mower until you have read and understand all instructions and the battery is fully charged. Read the safety considerations section of your Owner's Manual before performing any repairs or maintenance.</div>
  <h3>How should I maintain my Neuton battery for the longest life possible?</h3>
  <p><strong>All 36 Volt Models:</strong> Before you use your mower for the first time in the spring, be sure to fully charge the battery. In general you should charge the battery for 10 - 12 hours. If you have an auto shut off charger, it will be about 14 hours before the charger automatically shuts off. When the battery is fully charged it should be unplugged from the battery and wall.</p>

  <p><strong>All 24 Volt Models:</strong> Always store your battery fully charged. In general, you should charge your 24 Volt battery for 20 - 30 hours. When completed the charger should always be unplugged from the battery and wall.</p>

  <p><strong>All Models - 24V &amp; 36V:</strong> Fully charge the battery as soon as possible after each use &mdash; even if you only use the mower for a short time. Never store the battery in a discharged or partially discharged state.</p>
  <p>Keep fully charged batteries disconnected from the charger. The charger should be unplugged to keep it from drawing power. Try not to drain the battery completely. When you notice the battery losing power, stop and swap in a spare.</p>
  <p><strong>Off Season Storage:</strong> At the end of the mowing season, remove the battery from the mower and charge it before storing. Store it separate from the mower in a dry environment. The battery is safe to store at temperatures of +5&deg;. F (-15&deg;. C) to + 104&deg;. F (+40&deg;. F). Recharge the battery every 1-2 months during the off season in temperatures between +32&deg;. F (0&deg;. C) and + 104&deg;. F (+40&deg;. F).</p>
  <h3>How much run time can I expect from the battery?</h3>
  <p>Under typical mowing conditions, the Battery charge should last for approximately forty-five (45) to sixty (60) minutes per use but this may diminish over time. The length of time depends on the length, density, and dampness of the grass as well as battery charging time and mowing height. If the grass is dense or damp, the battery charge may diminish more quickly. Raising the cutting height and keeping the blade sharp can help to alleviate the load on the battery and motor.</p>
  <p>If you generally intend to use your Mower and Trimmer for a longer duration, Neuton, Inc. recommends that you purchase an extra Battery. That way, you could have a second fully charged Battery ready so you can continue mowing.</p>
  <h3>How do I order a replacement battery or charger? Do you sell the charger separately?</h3>
  <p>Both the <a href="/p/000000000000360801">battery for the Neuton CE6 Mower</a> and <a href="/p/000000000000360591">Charger</a> are available.

  <h3>Can I purchase the batteries from another source?</h3>

  <h3>How do I recycle my battery?</h3>
